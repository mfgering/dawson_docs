FOREWORD

This Code of Ordinances for the City of Raleigh was originally provided by the North Carolina League of Municipalities as part of its services program. Technical staff assistance was provided by Public Research and Management, Inc., of Atlanta, Georgia, which was responsible for the organization, codification, indexing and printing of the Code. 

The Code consists of: 

The Charter, followed by a tabulation of all local acts affecting the City of Raleigh: 

The Code of Ordinances, which includes citations referring to the official source and date of original ordinances, and those without citations representing new ordinances. 

This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The parts, chapters and articles of the Code follow in logical order. The table of contents, the sectional analysis at the beginning of each chapter and the indices provided sufficient points of reference for all elements of the code. 

Supplements will be published to keep the Code current. The supplements are printed in loose-leaf form so that all new ordinances may be inserted on a regular basis. 

Beginning with Supplement No. 3, 3-82, the Code was published by the editorial staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. 

In 1993, the Code was republished in a new format, using the format of the 1992 Zoning Ordinance, included as Part 10, Chapter 2. This republication was under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation.

</front-matter><charter><article id="I" title="IN GENERAL"><section num="1.1" title="SHORT TITLE.">This Act shall be known as and may be cited as "The Charter of the City of Raleigh." 
</section><section num="1.2" title="INCORPORATION.">The inhabitants of the City of Raleigh, within the corporate limits as now established or as hereafter established by statute or otherwise as provided by law, shall be and continue, as they have heretofore been, a municipal body politic and corporate, under the name of "The City of Raleigh," and under such name shall have perpetual succession. 
</section><section num="1.3" title="CORPORATE LIMITS.">The corporate boundaries of the City shall be those existing at the time of the ratification and effective date of this Charter and as the same may be altered from time to time in accordance with applicable laws and illustrated by a map on file in the Raleigh Municipal Building. In lieu of maintaining a written metes and bounds description of the corporate limits of the City, the City Council shall approve a map showing the then current corporate boundaries of the City and the electoral districts therein, from and after which time such map shall constitute the official map of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts of the City, as such map may be officially revised from time to time by appropriate action of the City Council. The Planning Director, in consultation with the Chief Engineer, shall draw the original map for City Council approval and shall revise such map as the City Council authorizes revisions thereto by appropriate action. From time to time, when additional territory shall have been annexed in accordance with law so as to become part of the municipal territory of the City of Raleigh, and from time to time when the electoral districts of the City shall have been revised and re-established in accordance with law, the official map of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts shall be revised accordingly and, as so revised, shall be presented to the City Council for appropriate action. Such revised map, when duly approved by the City Council, shall thereupon become the official map of the City of Raleigh and shall supersede all prior maps of the corporate boundaries and electoral districts of the City. All such prior official maps shall be preserved as public records and kept on file by the City Clerk, and shall be subject to public inspection during regular office hours. The latest official map, properly identified and bearing the certificate of the City Clerk evidencing its approval by the City Council and stating the date of such action by the City Council, shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk and shall be subject to public inspection during the regular office hours of the City Clerk's office. Copies of the official map reproduced by any method of reproduction that gives legible and permanent copies, when certified by the City Clerk, shall be admissible in evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as the original map from which the copy is made. 

(S.L. 1955, Ch. 627, §1; H.B. No. 405, 4-24-59; S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(a))
</section><section num="1.4" title="FORM OF GOVERNMENT.">The form of government for the City of Raleigh shall be known as the "Council-Manager Government" and shall be as set forth in Plan D of Part 4 of Article 22 of Chapter 160 [Article 7, Part 2, Chapter 160A] of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as heretofore adopted by the electorate of the citizens of Raleigh, subject to the modifications set forth in this Act. All powers of the City shall be vested in an elective Council, hereinafter referred to as the "City Council" or as the "Council"; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to prevent the form of government of the City of Raleigh from being determined from time to time by a vote of the people of the City of Raleigh at an election as now or hereafter provided by law. 
</section><section num="1.5" title="GENERAL RIGHTS AND POWERS.">The City of Raleigh is hereby vested with all the property and rights of property which now belong to the said municipal corporation, and the City of Raleigh shall have all the powers granted to municipal corporations and to cities by the Constitution and by the General Laws of the State of North Carolina and by this Act, together with all the implied powers necessary to carry into execution all the powers granted. The City may acquire real or personal property within or without its corporate limits for the government welfare, benefit or improvement of the City and its citizens, in fee simple or any lesser interest or estate, by purchase, gift, devise, bequest, lease, condemnation, dedication or otherwise, and may acquire, sell, lease, mortgage, hold, manage and control, such property, real or personal, as its interest may require and as shall be deemed advisable by the governing body of the City of Raleigh and as shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Charter and the General Laws of the State of North Carolina. The City of Raleigh shall have the power to adopt a corporate seal, to contract and be contracted with, to sue and be sued, and plead and be impleaded. Except as prohibited by the Constitution and the General Laws of the State of North Carolina or restricted by this Charter and other statutes applicable to the City of Raleigh, the City shall have and may exercise all municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges and immunities of every kind and nature whatsoever, as may be necessary, proper, or usually appertaining to municipal corporations. The enumeration of particular powers by this Charter shall not be deemed to be exclusive, and in addition to the powers enumerated herein or implied hereby, or appropriate to the exercise of such powers, it is intended that the City of Raleigh shall have and may exercise all powers which, under the Constitution and the laws of the State of North Carolina, it would be competent for this Charter specifically to enumerate.

</section><section num="1.7" title="PROPERTY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS VESTED IN CITY.">All property, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever character or description, and wheresoever situated, now held, controlled, or used by the City of Raleigh for any purpose, or which may hereafter be held, controlled, or used by said City, or which may have been vested in said City by virtue of any law of the State of North Carolina, and any and all judgments, liens, rights of liens, and causes of action of any and all kinds in favor of the City of Raleigh, shall vest in and remain and inure to the City of Raleigh, its successors and assigns, under this Act.

</section><section num="2.11" title="GRANTING OF FRANCHISES.">(a)	No franchise initially granted to any public utility regulated by the North Carolina Public Utilities Commission shall be effective until the question has been submitted at a general or special election to the qualified voters of the City and until a majority of those voting on the proposition have voted in favor of granting such franchise. Any renewal of any franchise granted a public utility as hereinbefore defined or the grant of a franchise other than to a public utility company regulated by the North Carolina Public Utilities Commission may be granted in the Council's discretion; provided, however, that any franchise granted without a vote of the people shall be subject to a referendum as provided in §24 of Chapter 1184 of the Session Laws of North Carolina, 1949, as amended except that the number of qualified voters required by §24(b) [2.16(b)] for purposes of this section shall be five per cent (5%) rather than ten per cent (10%); and provided further that any franchise which initially requires a vote to become effective shall not be subject to the referendum provided in §24 of Chapter 1184 of the Session Laws of North Carolina, 1949, as amended. 

(b)	In all elections upon the granting of franchises, whether said election is held pursuant to an initial grant or otherwise, the person, persons or corporation applying for said franchise shall deposit with the City Treasurer a sum which in the opinion of the City Council will be sufficient to defray the expenses of such election; provided that no franchise shall be granted for a longer time than 60 years from the date of the granting of such franchise. 

(c)	Every grant of any franchise or right, as hereinbefore provided, shall make provision, by way of the forfeiture of the grant or otherwise, for the purpose of compelling compliance with the terms of the grant, and to secure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of the property in good condition throughout the full term of the grant; and when the grant of any franchise or right is made, the City shall not part with the power to expressly reserve the right and duty at all times to exercise, in the interest of the public, full superintendence, regulation and control, in respect to all matters connected with the police powers of said City; and before any such grant of any such franchise or right shall be made, the proposed specific grant shall be embodied in the form of an ordinance, with all the terms and conditions that may be right and proper, including a provision for fixing a rate, fares and charges to be made if the grant provide for the charging of a rate, fares and charges; provided, that this act shall not modify any rights, privileges and franchises heretofore legally granted by the City to any person, firm or corporation; and provided further, that any and all rights, privileges and franchises that have been heretofore or that may be hereafter granted to or held by any person, firm or corporation in the streets, alleys, sidewalks, public grounds or places in said City shall, except when such imposition by the City is prohibited by any statute now or hereafter in effect, be subject to a tax by said City in such amount as the City Council may think to be just, separate from and in addition to the other assets of such person, firm or corporation, and in addition to a license tax; and the City Council may require the rendition and assessment thereof accordingly. 

(S.L. 1967, Ch. 915, §1)

Annotation: Kornegay v. Raleigh, 269 N.C. 155, 152 S.E.2d 186 (1967). Franchises not authorized by general law must conform to all procedures required by local law. 

Editor's note: Subsequent to this court decision, this Charter provision was amended by 1967 Session Laws, Ch. 915.

</section><section num="2.15" title="EXTENSION OF APPLICATION OF HEALTH, SANITARY AND PROTECTIVE ORDINANCES.">All ordinances, rules, and regulations of the City of Raleigh now in force, or that may hereafter be adopted by the City Council in the exercise of the police powers given to it for sanitary and health purposes, or for the protection of the property of the City, unless otherwise provided by the City Council, shall, in addition to applying to the territory within the City limits, apply with equal force to the territory outside of said City limits, within one mile in all directions of same, and to the right-of-way of all sewer, water, and electric light lines of the City, without the corporate limits, and to the rights-of-way, without the City limits, or any street railway company, or extension thereof, operating under a franchise granted by the City, and upon all property and rights-of-way of the City outside the said corporate limits and the above mentioned territorial limits, wheresoever the same may be located. 
</section><section num="2.16" title="INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.">(a)Power of Initiative.

The electors shall have power to propose any ordinance, except an ordinance appropriating moneys or authorizing the levy of taxes, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls, such power being known as the initiative. Any initiated ordinance may be submitted to the Council by a petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least ten per centum of the registered voters at the last regular municipal election. 

(b)Power of Referendum.

The electors shall have power to approve or reject at the polls any ordinance passed by the Council, or submitted by the Council to a vote of the electors, except an ordinance appropriating money or authorizing the levy of taxes, such power being known as the referendum. Ordinances submitted to the Council by initiative petition and passed by the Council without change shall be subject to the referendum in the same manner as other ordinances. Within twenty days after the enactment and publication by the Council of any ordinance which is subject to a referendum, a petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least ten per centum of the registered voters at the last preceding regular municipal election may be filed with the City Clerk requesting that any such ordinance be either repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. 

(c)Form of Petitions; Committee of Petitioners.

All petition papers circulated for the purpose of an initiative or referendum shall be substantially uniform in size and style. Initiative petition papers shall contain the full text of the proposed ordinance. The signatures to initiative or referendum petitions need not all be appended to one paper, but to each separate petition there shall be attached a statement of the circulator thereof as provided by this section. Each signer of any such petition paper shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall indicate after his name his place of residence by street and number, or other description sufficient to identify the place. There shall appear on each petition the names and addresses of the same five electors, who, as a committee of the petitioners, shall be regarded as responsible for the circulation and filing of the petition. Attached to each separate petition paper there shall be an affidavit of the circulator thereof that he, and he only, personally circulated the foregoing paper, that it bears a stated number of signatures, that all signatures appended thereto were made in his presence, and that he believes them to be genuine signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be. 

(d)Filing, Examination, Amendment and Certification of Petitions.

All petition papers shall be assembled and filed with the City Clerk as one instrument. Within five (5) business days after a petition is filed, the City Clerk shall examine the petition papers to determine whether each paper conforms to the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) herein and whether the number of signatures on valid petition papers is prima facie equal at least to the minimum number required. In making his examination, the City Clerk shall declare any petition paper entirely invalid which lacks any one of the following items; viz: The text of the proposed ordinance or the identification of the ordinance upon which a referendum is asked, the names of the committee members responsible for the petition, or the affidavit of the circulator. If a petition paper is found to be signed by more persons than the number of signatures certified by the circulator, the last signatures in excess of the number certified shall be disregarded and the City Clerk shall clearly indicate the cutoff point. If a petition paper is found to be signed by fewer persons than the number certified, the Clerk shall indicate the actual number of signatures. If the number of signatures on the valid petition papers shall be less than the number necessary, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate addressed to the committee of the petitioners setting forth the particulars in which the petition is defective. The committee shall be allowed ten business days to amend their petition by filing additional petition papers, but in no case shall any invalid petition paper be returned to the committee for perfection. In the event an amendment is filed, the City Clerk shall determine within five business days whether the petition as amended is now sufficient. If he find it still to be insufficient, he shall file his certificate to that effect in his office and notify the committee of the petitioners of his findings and no further action shall be had on such insufficient petition. Provided, however, that the finding of the insufficiency of an initiative petition shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose. If the City Clerk find the petition to be prima facie sufficient, he shall deliver the same to the Wake County Board of Elections for a checking of the names of the signers against the registration books. The board of elections shall complete its check within fifteen business days; provided, however, that the said board shall not be obligated to conduct a check in any thirty-day period immediately preceding, or in any ten-day period immediately following, a County-wide or City-wide election. In making its check of names, the said board shall be bound by the finding of the City Clerk as to validity of any particular petition paper and shall follow the rules set out above concerning petitions found to have different numbers of signers than those stated in the affidavits. Upon the completion of its check, the board of elections, through its Chairman or other duly authorized official, shall certify the outcome to the City Clerk. This certificate shall state (1) the total number of registered voters at the time of the most recent regular election of the members of the City Council, [(2)] the number of voters registered in the City of Raleigh whose names appear on the petition papers that the board found it necessary to examine, and [(3)] whether or not this number is sufficient for the submission of the proposed issue or issues to popular vote. If it was found unnecessary to check all names on the petition papers, this fact shall be indicated in the certificate. The petition papers shall be returned to the City Clerk by the County Board of Elections together with its certificate. 

(e)Certification of Sufficient Petition; Effect on a Referendum Petition of Certification.

Upon receiving the certificate of the Wake County Board of Elections, the City Clerk shall prepare a final certificate indicating the result of the board's examination and shall submit this certificate to the next regular meeting of the City Council. Whenever a referendum petition, or amended petition, has been certified as sufficient by the City Clerk, the ordinance specified in the petition shall not go into effect until and unless approved by the electors, as hereinafter provided. 

(f)Consideration by the City Council.

Whenever the City Council shall receive an initiative or referendum petition certified to be sufficient by the City Clerk as provided in paragraph (e) hereof, it shall proceed at once to consider such petition. A proposed initiative ordinance shall be read and provision shall be made for a public hearing upon the proposed ordinance. The Council shall take final action on the ordinance not later than sixty days after the date on which such ordinance was submitted to the Council by the City Clerk. A referred ordinance shall be reconsidered by the Council and its final vote upon such reconsideration shall be taken not later than the second regular meeting of the Council following the certification and shall be upon the question, "Shall the ordinance specified in the referendum petition be repealed?". 

(g)Submission of Ordinance to Electors.

If the Council shall fail to pass an ordinance proposed by initiative petition, or shall pass it in a form different from that set forth in the petition therefor, or if the Council fail to repeal a referred ordinance, the proposed or referred ordinance shall be submitted to the electors not less than thirty days nor more than one year from the date the Council takes its final vote thereon. The Council may, in its discretion, and if no regular election is to be held within such period shall, provide for a special election. Provided that, in case the Council shall pass an ordinance proposed by initiative petition in a form different from that set forth in the petition, the initiative form of the ordinance shall be submitted to the electors of the City only if, within twenty business days after the passage and publication of the ordinance in different form by the City Council, an additional petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least five per centum of the registered voters at the time of the last regular municipal election is submitted to the City Council. The same rules that governed the filing, examination, amendment and certification of the original petition shall apply to the additional petition. 

(h)Form of Ballot for Initiated and Referred Ordinances.

Ordinances submitted to vote of the electors in accordance with the initiative and referendum provisions of this charter shall be submitted by ballot title, which shall be prepared in all cases by the principal legal adviser of the City. The ballot title may be different from the legal title of any such initiated or referred ordinance and shall be a clear, concise statement, without argument or prejudice, descriptive of the substance of such ordinance. The ballot used in voting upon any ordinance, if a paper ballot, shall have below the ballot title the following propositions, one above the other, in the order indicated: "FOR THE ORDINANCE" and "AGAINST THE ORDINANCE." Immediately at the left of each proposition there shall be a square in which by making a cross (X) the elector may vote for or against the ordinance. Any number of ordinances may be voted on at the same election and may be submitted on the same ballot, but any paper ballot used for voting thereon shall be for that purpose only. If voting machines are used, the ballot title of any ordinance shall be presented in such manner as to permit the elector to vote for or against the ordinance. 

(i)Result of Election.

If a majority of the electors voting on a proposed initiative ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon be an ordinance of the City. A referred ordinance which is not approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon shall thereupon be deemed repealed. If conflicting ordinances are approved by the electors at the same election, the one receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict. 

(j)Publication, Amendment, and Repeal of Initiative or Referendum Ordinances.

Initiative and referendum ordinances adopted or approved by the electors shall be published and shall take effect as do other ordinances. Such initiative or referendum ordinances may be repealed only by vote of the electors of the City. The City Council may request the Wake County Board of Elections to submit a proposition for the repeal of any such ordinances, or for amendments thereto, to be voted upon at any succeeding general City election; and should any such proposition so submitted receive a majority of the votes cast thereon at such election, such ordinance shall thereby be repealed or amended accordingly. 

(k)Restrictions on Use of Initiative Process.

The initiative process shall not be used to reverse the result of a referendum until one (1) year shall have passed since the referendum vote or the effective date of the referred ordinance, whichever shall be the more recent. Nor shall the same question be submitted to the voters twice in the same twelve-month period. 

(l)Use of Initiative Process To Repeal an Existing Ordinance.

In the event the initiative process is used for the purpose of the repeal of an existing ordinance, the petition shall set out the ordinance the repeal of which is sought, and a vote shall be had only on the question of the repeal of such ordinance. If such process is used for the purpose of the repeal of a part of an existing ordinance, the vote shall be had only on the question of the repeal of that part of the ordinance set out in the petition.

</section><section num="4.2" title="RECALL OF OFFICIALS BY THE PEOPLE.">The holder of any elective office may be removed at any time by the electors qualified to vote for a successor of such incumbent. The procedure to effect the removal of an incumbent of an elective office shall be as follows: 

(1)	A petition signed by electors entitled to vote for a successor to the incumbent sought to be removed, equal in number of at least twenty-five (25) per centum of the entire number of voters casting votes at the last preceding general municipal election, demanding an election of a successor of the person sought to be removed, shall be filed with the Clerk, which petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds on which the removal is sought. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one paper, but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence, giving the street and number. One (1) of the signers of each such paper shall make oath before an officer competent to administer oaths that the statements therein made are true as he believes, and that each signature to the paper appended is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten days from the date of filing such petition, the City Clerk shall examine and from the voters' register ascertain whether or not said petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, and he shall attach to said petition his certificate showing the results of such examination. 

(2)	If, by the Clerk's certificate, the petition is shown to be insufficient, it may be amended within ten days from the date of said certificate. The Clerk shall, within ten days after such amendment, make like examination of the amended petition, and if his certificate shall show the same to be insufficient, it shall be returned to the person filing the same; without prejudice, however, to the filing of a new petition to the same effect. 

(3)	If the petition shall be found to be sufficient, the Wake County Board of Elections shall order and fix a date for holding a primary, as provided for in cases preceding regular municipal elections, the said primary to be held not more than sixty days from the date of the Clerk's certificate to the Wake County Board of Elections that a sufficient petition is filed. If in the primary election any candidate receives a majority of all the votes cast, he shall be declared to be elected to fill out the remainder of the term of the officer who is sought to be recalled. If there be more than two candidates in such primary, and no one receives a majority of all the votes cast therein, then there shall be an election held within twenty days from the date of the primary, at which election the two candidates receiving the highest vote in the primary shall be voted for. Candidates named shall be placed on the ticket in the primary and election held and the results canvassed, under the same rules, conditions, and regulations as are prescribed for the primaries preceding a regular municipal election in the City of Raleigh. 

(4)	The Wake County Board of Elections shall make, or cause to be made, publication for ten days of notice and all arrangements for holding such election, and the same shall be conducted, returned, and the results thereof declared in all respects as other City elections in the City of Raleigh. The successor of any officer so removed shall hold office during the unexpired term of his predecessor. Any person sought to be removed may be a candidate to succeed himself, and unless he requests otherwise in writing, his name shall be placed on the official ballot without nomination. At such election, if some other person than the incumbent is elected, the incumbent shall thereupon be deemed removed from the office upon qualification of his successor. 

(5)	In case the person elected should fail to qualify within ten days after receiving notification of election, the office shall be filled by election by the City Council, but the officer or councilor removed shall not be eligible to election by the City Council, and the person so elected by the City Council shall be subject to recall as other officers and councilors. If the incumbent received a majority of votes in the primary or the election, he shall continue in office. The said method of removal shall be cumulative and additional to any other method provided by law. The expense of calling and conducting any such election shall be paid by the City of Raleigh.

For this purpose, a person shall be deemed to be disabled if, as a result of the certification of a physician, or as a result of an independent investigation by the City Council, it determines that a member is too infirm, either physically or mentally, to discharge his duties adequately and consistently.

(i)	The City Council, in its discretion, is hereby authorized and empowered in the exercise of the police powers of the City, to pass and adopt and to amend and/or repeal all ordinances and resolutions, and to do all things necessary, to carry out the recommendations that may be made by the City Planning Commission, under the provisions and powers of this section, where not contrary to law. 

(S.L. 1973, Ch. 319, §1(t))
</section><section num="6.39" title="ZONING REGULATIONS.">(a)	For the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the City, the City Council is hereby authorized and empowered by ordinance to regulate and restrict the location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the per centage of a lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of population and the location and uses of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, business, residence or other purposes, including off-street parking of vehicles. Such ordinances may provide that the board of adjustment may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate principles, standards, rules, conditions and safeguards set forth in the ordinance, make special exceptions to the terms of the zoning regulations in harmony with their general purpose and intent. Such ordinances may provide that the board of adjustment may authorize variances from the strict application of the regulations in such situations and subject to such limitations as may be set forth in the ordinance. 

(b)	For any and all said purposes and under a comprehensive plan, the City Council may divide the municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purpose of this section; and within such districts the City Council may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair and use of buildings, structures, and land. All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of building throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts; however, the City Council may provide for the creation of conditional use zoning districts, and overlay zoning districts and transitional zoning regulations, in addition to general use districts. 

It is the purpose and intent of this section to permit the City to create, through the legislative process, general use districts, in which a variety of uses are permitted; conditional use districts, in which limited uses are permitted only upon approval by the City; and overlay zoning districts, which are applied coincidental with a general or conditional use district. Said overlay zoning districts may impose additional regulations on some property within the underlying general or conditional use district and not on all properties within those districts. 

A person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land where conditional use districts or overlay districts are authorized by ordinance, may elect to request a general use district, a conditional use district, or an overlay district for the tract. 

If the petitioner elects to petition for the general use or overlay district zoning, and if the petition is approved, the rezoned property may be used for any of the uses permitted in the applicable general use or overlay district. If the petitioner elects to petition for conditional use district zoning, the petition must specify the actual use or uses, and all other development regulations authorized by State law, which are intended for the property specified in the petition. The intended use or uses and development regulations must be permitted in the corresponding general use district. If the petition is for conditional use district zoning, the City Council is to approve or disapprove the petition on the basis of the specific use or uses and development regulations requested. 

(c)	Such regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements. Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout such municipality. 

(d)	The City Council shall by ordinance provide for the manner in which such regulations and restrictions and the boundaries of such districts shall be determined, established and enforced, and from time to time amended, supplemented or changed. No such regulation, restriction or boundary or any amendment, supplement or change therein shall become effective until the same shall have been submitted to the City Planning Commission for its recommendations and until such recommendations have been made to the City Council, and until after a public hearing in relation thereto shall be held by and before the City Council at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. A notice of such public hearing shall be published once a week for two (2) successive calendar weeks, immediately preceding the date of such hearing, in a newspaper published in the City and qualified to publish legal advertising, said notice to be published the first time not less than fifteen days prior to the date fixed for said hearing. 

(e)	Such regulations, restrictions and boundaries may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed. In case, however, of a protest against such change filed at or before the public hearing by the governing body of the municipality, required to be held by G.S. 160-175 (G.S. 160A-381385), and signed by the owners of twenty per cent or more of the area of the lots included in such proposed change, or of those immediately adjacent thereto, either in the rear, in the front, or on either side thereof extending one hundred feet therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto across a street therefrom, extending one hundred feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of three-fourths of all the members of the City Council. The provisions of this section relative to public hearings and official notice shall apply equally to all changes or amendments. 

(f)	The City Planning Commission shall have power to make recommendations concerning the boundaries of the various districts and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein. The City Planning Commission shall hold public hearings on proposed regulations, restrictions and boundaries, and proposed amendments, changes and modifications therein before submitting its final report thereon to the City Council, and the City Council shall not take action until it has received the final report of the City Planning Commission.
